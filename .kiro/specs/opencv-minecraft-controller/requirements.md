# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a computer vision-based controller for Minecraft that uses OpenCV to track arm pose through a camera. The system detects the player's elbow joint angle and translates specific angle ranges into mouse click controls - right-click for angles below 60 degrees, left-click for angles above 90 degrees, and neutral (no clicks) for angles between 60-90 degrees.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Minecraft player, I want to control left and right mouse clicks using my arm movements, so that I can interact with the game hands-free through pose detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects an elbow angle below 60 degrees THEN the system SHALL hold down the right mouse button
2. WHEN the system detects an elbow angle above 90 degrees THEN the system SHALL hold down the left mouse button  
3. WHEN the system detects an elbow angle between 60-90 degrees THEN the system SHALL release both mouse buttons (neutral position)
4. WHEN the user returns to neutral position from either click state THEN the system SHALL immediately release the corresponding mouse button

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to accurately detect my arm pose through a camera, so that the mouse controls respond reliably to my movements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the camera is active THEN the system SHALL continuously capture video frames for pose detection
2. WHEN a person is visible in the camera frame THEN the system SHALL detect and track arm keypoints using pose estimation
3. WHEN arm keypoints are detected THEN the system SHALL calculate the elbow joint angle in real-time
4. IF pose detection fails or no person is visible THEN the system SHALL maintain neutral state (no mouse clicks)
5. WHEN pose detection resumes THEN the system SHALL immediately respond to the current arm position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback of the pose detection and current control state, so that I can see how my movements are being interpreted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN the system SHALL display the camera feed with pose overlay
2. WHEN arm keypoints are detected THEN the system SHALL draw the arm skeleton on the video display
3. WHEN the elbow angle is calculated THEN the system SHALL display the current angle value on screen
4. WHEN a mouse button state changes THEN the system SHALL display the current control state (left-click/right-click/neutral)
5. WHEN pose detection is active THEN the system SHALL highlight the elbow joint being tracked

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily start and stop the pose control system, so that I can enable/disable the feature when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the camera and pose detection models
2. WHEN the user presses a designated key THEN the system SHALL toggle pose control on/off
3. WHEN pose control is disabled THEN the system SHALL stop sending mouse commands but continue showing the camera feed
4. WHEN the user closes the application THEN the system SHALL properly release camera resources and stop all mouse control
5. IF camera initialization fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and gracefully exit

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that temporary issues don't crash the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the camera becomes unavailable during operation THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and display a warning message
2. IF pose detection fails temporarily THEN the system SHALL maintain the last known state until detection resumes
3. IF mouse control commands fail THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue pose detection
4. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL reduce frame processing rate to maintain stability
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL safely shut down and release all resources
